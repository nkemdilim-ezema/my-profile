	<h2>Dancing🕺🎶</h2>

		I started dancing when i was little. I never really went to a dance school but i loved dancing at home. With time, I improved my dancing skills. the dances I do are hiphop, jazz and afrobeats. In my free time, I also dance on  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kemdyy2?_t=8hEEcnKPdAb&_r=1">Tiktok.</a>

<h2> Modelling💃</h2>
<p>
	As a child, I would watch people walk on runway shows. I knew from that moment I wanted to be a model too. My dream was beginning to look bright when i was casted as a model for MODESSEC (a fashion association for ESSEC). I was lucky to walk in front of over 200 guests. I would say that was the best time of my life. Below are some pictures of the night.
